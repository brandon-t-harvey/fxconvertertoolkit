# FxConverterToolkit
FxConverterToolkit is a toolkit for converting JavaFX based graphics and GUI elements to various vector graphics output formats such as EPS, SVG and PDF, via intermediary transcoding to AWT using the excellent JFXConverter library by Herv√© Girod, which allows one to connect legacy AWT-based Java libraries to JavaFX application elements.

Maven support will hopefully be added within the next day or two.
